          <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because

          <li>good practice to create new branches for new features and starting names with "feature/"</li>
          <li>git push origin (branch name) pushes feature branch to GitHub repository</li>
          <li>pull request (PR) allows us to merge comparison branch (feature branch) into base branch -- main</li>
          <li>GitHub workflow: ensuring code is up to date by using "git pull origin main", creating feature branches for new features, pushing features to repo with "git push origin (branch name)", merging feature branch to main by creating and approving a pull request (PR), then ensuring local repo is up to date by using "git pull origin main"</li>
          <li>version control allows us to store copies/versions of the code at different points which helps undo changes and go back to previous iterations of the code</li>

          <li>Console.log prints messages to console -- can be viewed using Chrome DevTools (right click -> inspect)</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted by using conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed or if it is even executed at all</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>Functions are not automatically executed; must be called by name in order to execute</li>
